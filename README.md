# Circle API Postman Collections
This repository contains all collections that Circle provides within the [Postman Circle Workspace](https://www.postman.com/circle-solutions/workspace/circle-developers/overview). This includes a collection for General, Core, Payments, Payouts, and Accounts API. Within each of these collections are folders that are organized one to one with how we organize our [API References](https://developers.circle.com/reference/). 

## Prerequisites

### Set your API key
For authorization, we have inserted the postman variable `apiKey`. Please add your base64 encoded bearer token to your environment or collection variables. Please see Postmanâ€™s [using variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) for more information.

If you do not have an API Key head over to our Sandbox [signup form](https://my-sandbox.circle.com/signup).
